On the Details view you can make some basic changes directly within FileMaker. For any changes involving the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or JSON, it is recommended that you open the Bundle in an editing tool. Carafe provides two main  options:
 
 * Direct integration with [CodeSandbox](../../carafe-codesandbox/introduction/)
 * Integration with all professional desktop code editors via the [Carafe Bundler](../../carafe-bundle-creator/).
 
 Click either link for more details on these options.
