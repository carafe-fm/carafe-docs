# Quick Start

1. Open _FileMaker Pro Advanced > Preferences > Plugins_.
    * Ensure that _Allow Solutions to Install Files_ is enabled.
1. Open **Carafe.fmp12** and choose a Bundle.
    * Follow the prompts in _Deploy > Standard_ to add it to your solution.
1. Create a new empty Web Viewer with object name `web` in your solution.
    * (You may choose to customize the object name later.)

 Run the script you deployed. _**That's it!**_

Read the comments in the deployed script for details on replacing the sample data with your own data source.

Tip: If you plan to trigger FileMaker scripts from the Bundle, open _File > Manage > Securityâ€¦_ and ensure the `fmurlscript` Extended Privilege is enabled.
