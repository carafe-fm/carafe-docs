Generally speaking the Carafe Bundler is not something people will use directly, but rather will find it as an included utility in other tooling such as Carafe.FM and Carafe.fmp12 for validating Bundles.

Carafe Bundler is an NPM package for working with Carafe Bundles outside of the normal FileMaker Web Viewer context. For example:

1. It is packaged in an NPM Initializer to bootstrap a new Carafe Bundle project.
1. It is transpiled into a Browser Tool for rendering and validating Carafe Bundles in browser applications.
1. It can be packaged into any NPM project and used directly.
