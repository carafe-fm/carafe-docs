Carafe.js is a library that turbo-charges any Carafe Bundle project. It provides a Bundle developer with useful features such as a head loader, FM WebViewer Bridge, and a ready function that ensures all dependencies are loaded before your Bundle runs.

Find more details in the [Carafe.js project on GitHub](https://github.com/carafe-fm/carafe-js/blob/master/README.md).
